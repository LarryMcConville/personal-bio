                <p>Hi, I'm Larry McConville.  I'm currently a Technology Manager and feel that over the past 14 years I've gotten too far away from technology.  I originally became interested in technology through troubleshooting, repairing and upgrading PC's in the early-to-mid 90s.  At the time, I was working as a machinist and doing custom fabrication for a small company in Independence, MO.  One day while in the office talking with the owner I could hear people chatting about a problem in the fax/copy room.  The pc we used as the fax (EDI) server wasn't working and the Technology Services company they used for service work wouldn't be available for a week.  The sole purpose of this pc was to submit bids for work to the Deptartment of Defense; being down pretty much halted our ability to bid on government contracts.</p>
                <p>I asked the owner if I could take a look at the error message; he agreed likely thinking he didn't have much to lose at this point.  It turned out that the modem integrated into the motherboard wasn't working.  I grabbed the company credit card and ran up to Best Buy picking up a new modem.  Once I had the integrated modem disabled, and the new one installed, I had the machine back up and running with only a couple hours of down time.  The owner inquired if I had ever considered a career change, and after thinking about it for a year, I started DeVry in the fall of 1997.  At the time their Developer program was the mainframe stack, like others in our KU Bootcamp class, I too have Cobol in my closet!  I performed Microfocus Cobol and Oracle PL-SQL development for about 8 years and then went down the management track.</p>
